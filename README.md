# US_Bikeshare_Data_Final
This project was completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project in order to showcase my Python programming skills. I analyzed bikeshare data from three US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I created an interactive experience that enables a user through inputs to pull descriptive statistics about bikesharing in these cities based on use date (month, day, time), stations, user descriptions, and more.
